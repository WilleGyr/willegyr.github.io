# Custom Spotify Wrapped
*Flexible, personal, and fully under your control.*

This is a personal project I've been building during my free time:
a custom version of Spotify's Wrapped feature, fully under my own control.

Instead of being limited to what Spotify chooses to show,
this tool lets me generate and explore exactly the statistics and charts I want —
from top artists and songs to total listening time, monthly trends, and even genre breakdowns.

It basically tracks and analyzes your Spotify listening data and creates a custom Spotify Wrapped for you.

*The **[latest version](https://github.com/WilleGyr/Spotify_Wrapped/releases/latest)** requires a **[Spotify Developer account](https://developer.spotify.com/)**. If you don't have access to one, please download **[version 1.0.0](https://github.com/WilleGyr/Spotify_Wrapped/releases/tag/v1.0.0)**. View the **[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG)** for more information.
