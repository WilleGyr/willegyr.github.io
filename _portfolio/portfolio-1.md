An open-source Python app that generates a personalized version of Spotify Wrapped using real listening data, giving you complete control over your music stats. Unlike Spotify's official Wrapped, this tool lets you explore everything — top artists, songs, genres, trends over time, and more — all presented through interactive charts in a sleek GUI.

Built with a combination of Spotify’s API, Google Sheets, and Python-based data visualization, this project is tailored for users who want transparency and customization in how their listening habits are tracked and displayed.
